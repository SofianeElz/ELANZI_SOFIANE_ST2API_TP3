# ELANZI_SOFIANE_ST2API_TP3

What about this TP ( I swear I tried my best to make an .exe file...try it by yourself     spoiler : it does not work well, BUT the sln is OK )

From my point of view, connecting the API was not hard.
The hard part was to scrapp informations from the API, especially with the List Weather for example ( thanks stackoverflow ), this is what I found hard, accessing to datas.

S O L I D stands for Single responsibility - Open/closed - Liskov substitution - Interface segregation - Dependency inversion
KISS Keep it stupid simple, I think my code can relate with that, I made some pretty simple stuff.
Boy scoot rule, leave the camp cleaner than you found it, my code is not overloaded, I guess it is quite clean.

I can improve my TP by many ways.
I really tried to make an .exe, so the first way would be to propose a exe.
Then, add more features, like weather through time, past and future !
A more dynamic page, my interface is cool and stupid simple but a little more fun could be good.
Propose other services, Weather, Humidity, Comparison between two cities would be interesting.

That is pretty all for me !

Thanks sir for reading this
